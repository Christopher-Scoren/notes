## Introduction

The `command line` is a text interface for the computer’s operating system. You can use it to traverse and edit your computer’s filesystem. Through the command line, you can create new files, edit the contents of those files, delete files, and more.

 A `command` is a directive to the computer to perform a specific task.
 `$` - shell prompt

Command line is text-based. It doesn't have a graphical interface

## Navigating the File System

A filesystem organizes a computer’s files and directories into a tree structure

* The first directory in the filesystem is the root directory. It is the parent of all other directories and files in the filesystem.
* Each parent directory can contain more child directories and files.

Commands:  
`ls` - “lists” all the files and directories inside of the directory
`pwd` - print working directory
`cd` - change directory
> `$ cd 2015` When a file, directory, or program is passed into a command, it is called an argument. Here the 2015 directory is an argument for the cd command.
