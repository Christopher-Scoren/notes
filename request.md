## Introduction

`HTTP` stands for <ins>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</ins> and is used to structure requests and responses over the internet. HTTP requires data to be transferred from one point to another over the network.

HTTP is the command language that the devices on both sides of the connection must follow in order to communicate.

The transfer of resources happens using `TCP` (<ins>Transmission Control Protocol</ins>).
