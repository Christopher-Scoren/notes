## Introduction

When a server responds to a client, the server specifies a status code as a part of the response.  
Status codes indicate whether or not the HTTP request was successfully completed and if there was an error, they contain some information about the type of error that happened.  
The status code helps the browser know how to handle the data that was sent back with the response.

`CSS` stands for cascading style sheets

The internet has three basic parts:
* The last mile is the part of the internet that connects homes and small businesses to the internet.  
* Data centers are rooms full of servers that store user data and host online apps and content.  
* The backbone consists of long-distance networks — mostly on fiber optic cables — that carry data between data centers and consumers.
